Git is used for:
-Tracking code changes
-Tracking who made changes
-coding collaboration


working with Git:
.Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository 
.Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
.When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
.using git add files going to staging area and then 
. The staged files are committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
.Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
.You can revert back to any  previous commit.
.Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, keeps track of changes made in each commit!



git file process:
working directory(git add)-> staging area(git commit)-> repository

Git Install :
You can download Git for free: https://www.git-scm.com/

Check git version:
git --version

Configure Git:
git config --global user.name "kawchar-hossen"
git config --global user.email "kawcharhossencd@gmail.com"

also you can edit user name and email from file:
git config --global --edit
exit system from file:
Esc(escape)-> : ->WQ ->Enter.

how to check user name and email:
1. git config --global user.name
2. git config --global user.email

how to change drive directory:
cd "C/D/E:\folder name"

Creating Git Folder:
mkdir myproject //makdes a new directory
cd myproject    // changes the current working directory

Remove Git Folder:
rmdir myproject

Back From Git Folder:
cd ..


Initialize git for a folder:
Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder:
git init

After initalization now you are going to create a file inside :
touch file_name_with_extensions
or you can simply create a file inside current folder.

Checking File inside Folder:
ls
ls -a //checking with hidden file

Check the Git status and see if it is a part of our repo:
git status
No commits yet
Untracked files:
  (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
    index.html
nothing added to commit but untracked files present 

Now Git is aware of this file but has not been added to our repository.

how to add file on git: use for going to staging area:
git add file_name_with_file_type  // git status use for track file 
git add . // . use for all file go to staging area
git add --all or git add -A // use of adding more than one file or all file at a time.


how to use git commit: git commit use for going to repository:
git commit -m "initial commit" // "adding stack.c" or any other


check commit: 
git log


format change of command line:
1. git    //for git format
2. bash   //for git bash format.
3. cmd    //for windows command line format

Git Help:
git help -all //see all possible commands
git commit/init/push --help //show a page on website 
git commit/init/push -help  //show command line for this command 




going to commit into different area :
git checkout hash_code/// hash_code found from (git log) commit hash code)
git checkout master // use for back now position or branch name



create branch in master:(if we use branch than if we checkout a branch at the same time other branch didn't change.
git branch branch_name
git checkout branch_name
git checkout -b 'person_name/branch_name' //use for creating branch and checkout branch simultoneously


how to transfer one branch property to other branch:
git merge branch_name

Delete a branch:
git branch -d branch_name 


Ignore folder from tracking:
creating .gitignore file inside folder.
1. touch .gitignore.
2. or simply create .gitignore file from folder from vscode or drive
3. and we put all file name with file type. inside .gitignore file.//then all file  starting ignore from git. those are inside from .gitignore file

  
push on git:
1.git remote add origin/(or other_name) https://github.com/kawchar-hossen/filename.git
2. git branch -M main
3. git push -u origin branch_name
 

fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at 'D:/project'
'D:/project' is owned by:
        'S-1-5-21-1735448415-3792493074-1523754042-1001'
but the current user is:
        'S-1-5-21-1735448415-3792493074-1523754042-1010'
To add an exception for this directory, call:
git config --global --add safe.directory D:/project


1. ls   --> checking list inside folder
2. mkdir folder_nmae --> create folder
3. git init --> initalized empty git repository
4. ls -a --> show all hidden file
5. ls .git --> what is the inside git folder
6. touch file_nmae.txt --> create file
7. git status --> check how many file inside a folder
8. rm -rf file_name --> remove file
9. git add file_name --> add file on git
10. git commit -m "names.txt file added" -->

Git Fetch
fetch gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo.

So, on your local Git, fetch updates to see what has changed on GitHub:
